  Some limits that I would like to understand and find why they are such: </p>
  <p>(1)
  $$ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{a^h - 1}{h} = \log a$$
</p>
  <p>(2) gamma funcion
  $$ \Gamma (n) = \int^{\infty}_0{x^{n-1}e^{-x}}dx$$
  </p>
    <p>(3) Iterative method for finding the minimum of a function \(f\) using its derivatives:
$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f'(x_n)}{|f''(x_n)| + rnd(1)},$$
      where \( rnd(1) \) is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1.This is just and idea I had, I don't know if it will work. 
      I followed Newton's advice and my common sense.
      </p>
  <p> On the other hand Newton's method for finding the root of a function is very similar, it analytically yields 
  $$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. $$
