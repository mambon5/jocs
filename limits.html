  Some limits that I would like to understand and find why they are such: </p>
  <p>(1.1)
  $$ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{a^h - 1}{h} = \log a$$
</p>

<p>
    (1.2) I really don't get how could we show the following identity:
    $$ (a+p)^p = \inf_{t \in (0,1)}t^{1-p}a^p + (1-t)^{1-p}b^p$$
    </p>
    
  <p>(2) gamma funcion
  $$ \Gamma (n) = \int^{\infty}_0{x^{n-1}e^{-x}}dx$$
  </p>
    <p>(3) Iterative method for finding the minimum of a function \(f\) using its derivatives:
$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f'(x_n)}{|f''(x_n)| + rnd(1)},$$
      where \( rnd(1) \) is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1.This is just and idea I had, I don't know if it will work. 
      I followed Newton's advice and my common sense.
      </p>
      <p>(4) and its vectorial version that I imagined to work best:
$$ p^{n+1}_i = p^n_i - \frac{f_{x_i}(p^n)}{|f_{x_ix_i}(p^n)| + rnd(1)},$$
      
</p>
  <p> On the other hand Newton's method for finding the root of a function is very similar, it analytically yields 
  $$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. $$
  </p>
  <p> (5) Counting the rational numbers in a clumsy but correct way 
  $$ \mathbb{Q} \simeq \mathbb{Z} $$
    $$ q = k/m \longmapsto f(k,m) = 1 + 1_{k > m}((k-1)^2 + m) + 1_{k < m}((m-1)(m-2) + k) $$
    $$ n \longmapsto g(n) = 1_{(m+1)^2 \geq n-1}\frac{n-1 - (m+1)m}{m+2} + 1_{ (m+1)^2 < n-1}\frac{m+2}{n-2-(m+2)m}, $$
    where \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \) so that
    $$ (m+1)m < n-1 $$
    $$ (m+2)(m+1) \geq n-1. $$
  </p>
    
    <p>(6) Product topology. Generate the euclidean ball \(B_{\delta}(a,b) \) in 2 dimensions using the product topology.
  $$ B_{\delta}(a,b) = \cap_{m \in R} Diag(m(x-a)+b,\delta), $$ where
      $$ Diag(m(x-a)+b,\delta) = \cup_{x \in R} \left( [x-\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{2}}, x+\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{2}} ] \vee \Omega_2 \right)
      \left(  \Omega_1 \vee [m(x-a)+b-\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{2}}, m(x-a)+b+\frac{\delta}{2\sqrt{2}} ]  \right). $$
  </p>
  
  <p> In order to prove the other inclusion (of the product topology of \( R^2 \) in the ordinary Euclidean topology of  \( R^2 \) we just observe that
  $$  p^{-1}([a,b]) = \cup_{i \in R }B_{\frac{b-a}{2}}(\frac{a+b}{2},i).  $$
    These two constructions prove that the product topology of \( R^2 \) is the same as the Euclidean topology of the same space.

    (7) refutation of cantelli's second implication if independence is dropped.  Second Cantellis statement:
    
    $$  \sum^{\infty}_1 P(A_n) = \infty  $$ and <br> \( A_n \) pairwise independent. <br> Then
    $$  P(\cap_{n=1}^{\infty} \cup_{k\geq n}^{\infty} A_k ) = 1.  $$
    
    Counterexample if \( A_n \) are not independent: Choose 
    $$ A_n = [0,1/n], \Omega = [0,1], P = unif on [0,1], \Sigma = < (a,b) | a,b \in [0,1]> $$ then
    \( P(A_n) = 1/n \rightarrow \sum_1^{\infty} = \infty \), but for \( k < n \),
    $$  P(A_n \cap A_k) = P(A_n) \neq P(A_n)(A_k) \rightarrow \text{not independent}.$$
     And \(  \cup_{k\geq n}^{\infty} A_k = A_n  \), \(  \cap_{n\geq 1}^{\infty} A_n = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}[0,1/n]= \{ 0 \}  \) and
                                                                            $$  P(\{0\}) = 0!! $$

  </p>
    
    <p> (8) proposition: If \( U \) has infinite points in \([0,T] \) with \( T < \infty \),  \( \rightarrow U  \) has an
      acc. point \(y \in [0,T]\). <br>
                                                                                   
     Proof: Otherwise, if \( U \) has no accumulation point in \( [0,T] \) then \( \forall x \in U, \exists \delta_x > 0 \) so that

      $$ (x-\delta_x, x+\delta_x)\cap U \backslash \{x\} = \oslash. $$
      But then you can take $$ \delta^* = \inf_{x\in U}\{\delta_x \} > 0 (*),$$
      (we will later prove (*)) and then the intervals \( (x-\delta^*, x], x \in U \) are pariwise disjoint and therefore
      $$  \cup_{x\in U}(x-\delta^*,x] \subseteq [0,T] .$$
      But $$ \mu_L \left( \cup_{x\in U}(x-\delta^*,x] \right) = \sum_{x\in U}\delta^* = \infty \rightarrow
      \mu_L[0,T] = \infty !!  $$
      Proof of (*): if $$ \inf_{x \in U}\{ \delta_x \} = 0 \rightarrow \forall \delta > 0 \exists x \in U $$ so that
      $$ (x-\delta, x+\delta)\cap U \backslash\{x\} \neq \oslash , $$
      but this means that \(x\) is an accumulation point ma friend.

      (9) Stopping times. Definition: \( \tau \) is a \( \mathcal{F}_t \) stopping time if $$ \{ \tau \leq t \}  \in \mathcal{F}_t \hspace{0.5cm} \forall t \in \mathbb{R}. $$
      Therefore, \( \tau \) is a \( \mathcal{F}_{t+} \) stopping time  $$ \leftrightarrow \{ \tau \leq t \}  \in \mathcal{F}_{t+} = \cap_{s>t} \mathcal{F}_s \hspace{0.5cm} \forall t \in \mathbb{R}, $$
      $$ \leftrightarrow \{ \tau < t \}  \in \mathcal{F}_{t} \hspace{0.5cm} \forall t \in \mathbb{R}. $$
    </p>
    
    <p>
    (10) If \(f: R^2   \rightarrow R \) is continuous then its inverse maps open 
    sets to open sets of \(\mathbb{R}^2 \). <br>
    Proof: Since the open sets in \(R\) are generated by taking arbritrary infinite 
    unions or finite intersections of sets of the form \(\{(a,\infty) | a \in R\}\),
    it is sufficient to show that $$ f^{-1}(a,\infty)  $$
    is an open set for every \( a \in R\). <br>
    
    (case 1) if \( f^{-1}(a,\infty) = \oslash \) then it lies in \(\mathcal{T}_R\). <br>
    (case 2) if \( f^{-1}(a,\infty) \neq \oslash \) then we have to see that 
    \( \forall q \in  f^{-1}(a,\infty) \exists \delta > 0 \) so that 
    \( B_{\delta}(q) \subseteq  f^{-1}(a,\infty). \) This will mean that every
    point in the antiimage has an open neighbourhood also in the antiimage of 
    \((a,\infty)\). But this is easy to show, since \( f^{-1}(a,\infty) \neq \oslash \)
    $$ \rightarrow \exists q \in R^2 | f(q) > a. $$
    Fix then $$ \epsilon = f(q) - a, $$
    since \(f\) is continuous there exists an \( \delta > 0\) so that
    $$ f(x) > a (*) \text{ if } ||x-q||_{l2} < \delta. $$
    This shows that $$ \{ x \text{ | } ||x-q||_{l2} < \delta  \} = B_{\delta}(q) \subseteq
    f^{-1}(a,\infty) = \{ x  \text{ | } f(x) > a \}.$$
    <br>
    Proof of \((*)\): We actually have that $$ |f(x) - f(q)| < \epsilon
    \rightarrow -\epsilon < f(x) - f(q) \rightarrow f(x) > f(q) - \epsilon = a.$$

    (11) Example of a Dynkyn system or \(\lambda\)-system \(\mathcal{L} \).
    <br>
    Given a state space \( \Omega \) and its \(\sigma \)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\),
    a common \(\lambda\)-system \(\mathcal{L} \) is that set of events where two
    measures \(P,Q\) agree on. I.e.
    $$ \mathcal{L} = \{A \in \mathcal{F} \text{ | } P(A) = Q(A) \}. $$
    Consider for instance two coin tosses. Then we have that the state space is
    $$ \Omega = \{HH,HT,TH,TT \}, $$
    and the event space is 
    $$ \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}^{\Omega} = 
    \{ \{HH\},\{HT\},\{TH\},\{TT\},\{HH, HT\},\{HH, TH\},\{HH, TT\}, $$ $$
    \{HT, TH\},\{HT, TT\},\{HT, TT\},\{HH, HT, TH\},\{HH, HT, TT\},
    \{HH, TH, TT\},\{HT, TH, TT\}, \{HH,HT,TH,TT \}  \} $$
    Consider the measure \(P\) that creates the completely unbiased probability 
    space $$ (\Omega, \mathcal{F},P), $$ where
    $$ P(\{HH\}) = P(\{HT\}) = P(\{TH\}) = P(\{TT\}) = 1/4. $$ 
    (is it enough to give the probabilities of the events that generate the 
    \(\sigma \)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}\)?) 
    <br>
    And the measure  \(Q\) that creates a probability space
    $$ (\Omega, \mathcal{F},Q) $$
    where the second toss is magically always equal to the first toss:
    $$ Q(\{TH\}) = Q(\{HT\}) = 0; Q(\{HH\}) = Q(\{TT\}) = 1/2. $$
    Then these two measures agree and have value of exactly 1/2 on each of the 
    following events except the last two:
    $$\mathcal{L} = \{ \{HH, HT\},\{HH, TH\},\{HT, TT\}, \{HT, TT\},
    \{HH,HT,TH,TT \}, \oslash \}.$$
    This is a \(\lambda\)-system which is not a \(\sigma\)-algebra.
